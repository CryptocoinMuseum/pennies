Pennies are straightforward cryptographic coins. They are based on YaCoin and use
Scrypt-Jane to encourage CPU-centric mining. They are designed to mint Proof of 
Stake blocks easily and encourage saving. They have no decimals and no micro or nano
units--every penny is a single coin! 

Minting of shiny new pennies can be done using the Command Line Banking Virtual 
Teller Window within the Piggy Bank. Freshly minted coins take 25 blocks to mature.
Pennies are not meant to have specific value or be keyed to a specific value in any
fiat or electronic currency. Pennies are a free-market cryptocurrency and are worth
simply what the market determines their worth to be.
